Why Tau?
----------------
TAU is the answer to Bitcoin’s lack of economic activity. It’s proven to be a great store of value but has not been able to jump into “medium of exchange”. With the innovation of Proof-of-Transactions, users are incentivized to make more transactions and increase circulation by receiving the block reward.
